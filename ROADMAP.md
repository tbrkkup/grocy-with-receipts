# Roadmap

## Planned Features

### Receipt Management (Web)
- [ ] Customizable receipt dropdown display format in the purchase form (user setting: e.g. `{date} – {store}` vs. `{date} – {description}`)
- [ ] File attachments for receipts (upload/view PDF or image per receipt)
- [ ] Import tool (`grocyimportv15`) automatically creates and links a receipt entry on import
- [ ] Stock journal: display linked receipt in journal rows

### Receipt Management (Android)
- See `grocy-with-receipts-android` ROADMAP.md

## Testing / QA (open)
- [ ] Tasks form "Save & add another": verify the background list refresh on the real deploy. Implemented and verified in the dev sandbox (branch `fix-save-and-add-other`, merged into `test-deploy-01-branch`), but not yet confirmed in production.
