-- The price history chart draws one line per store, so that prices are only compared
-- with comparable prices. Origin country and quality change the price of an otherwise
-- identical product just as much as the store does (organic tomatoes from Germany are
-- not the same purchase as conventional ones from Hungary), so both have to be part of
-- the price history as well.
